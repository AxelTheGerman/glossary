<p>CONTRIBUTION
Calculation: [sa] less the [cos]. 

CONTRIBUTION MARGIN
Ratio: Contribution as a percentage of [sa]

Contribution is what’s left from the sale to contribute towards paying for the overhead costs and expenses of the business.  

This is a real [wdym] term with people sometimes using the two terms interchangeably.  We use ‘margin’ to denote a percentage (of Sales). 

Contribution may be the same number as Gross Profit.

Example:  
- Sales of 200 less COS of 80 equals Contribution of 120
- Contribution of 120 divided by Sales of 200 equals Contribution Margin of 60%.
