<h1>Balance Sheet - <span>us</span></h1>
<p>A summary of the [as], [lia], and [eq] for the business at a certain point in time - it gives a financial snapshot for the given moment.  

The right side of [tcb] (and of the Income/Outcome business simulation game board) is a Balance Sheet.  

When using a numeric format, North America uses a [tabs] which shows the assets (what you have in the business) and balances that amount against the total of liabilities and equity (which is where the assets came from). In other words, everything you have in the business comes from investing ([cs]), making money ([re]), or borrowing from sources such as banks (Loans) and suppliers ([ap]).  Elsewhere in the world, a [tabs] may be used.
