<h1>Fixed Cost  - <span>us</span></h1>
<p>A cost incurred in the general operations of the business that is not directly attributable to the costs of producing goods and services.  These ‘Fixed’ or ‘Indirect’ costs will be incurred whether or not any sales are made during the period, thus the designation ‘Fixed’ as opposed to ‘[vc]’.</p>
