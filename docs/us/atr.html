<h1>Acid-Test Ratio  - <span>us</span></h1>
<p>Ratio: ([ca] less [inv]) divided by [cl]

This is a variant of the [crat]; it only includes items which are quickly converted into current assets. It is called ‘Acid-Test’ because it measures the ability to meet unexpected demands without depending on the sale of inventory.  

Also called Quick Ratio.  A Quick Ratio of 1 is a good benchmark. Higher ratios indicate a satisfactory condition. Decreasing ratios indicate either a deteriorating cash position or a deteriorating demand for products. Ratios below ½ indicate a potentially severe situation like slow moving inventory and a higher chance of bankruptcy.</p>
