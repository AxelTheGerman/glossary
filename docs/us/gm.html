GROSS MARGIN
Ratio: [gi] as a percentage of [sa] 


Gross Margin is the percentage of profit available after deducting from sales the direct (or variable) costs of labor and materials, and the costs of the overheads applied to the production of goods and services.

This is a real [wdym] with people sometimes using the two terms interchangeably.  We use ‘margin’ to denote a percentage (of [sa]). 

Example: 
- Sales of 200 less COS of 80 less factory overheads of 10 equals Gross Income of 110.
- Gross Income of 110 divided by Sales of 200 equals Gross Margin of 55%.
