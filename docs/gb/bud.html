<h1>Budget - <span>gb</span></h1>
<p>Expectations of Sales, Costs (or Expenses) and [Prof] for a future fiscal period (month, quarter, year).

This is definitely a [wdym] term.  Many people use it to mean ‘the amount of money they are allowed to spend’, meaning only ‘their’ costs/expenses portion of the actual budget.
