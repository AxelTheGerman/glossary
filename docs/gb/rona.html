<h1>Return on Net Assets (RONA) - <span>gb</span></h1>
<p>Ratio: [oi] as a percentage of the [nas] 

RONA shows the profit that managers are making as a percentage of the assets given them to manage.  Net Assets in this sense means the amount of [as] derived from [eq] and long-term debt.  Net Assets does not include supplier [ap] and other liabilities which the managers have generated themselves.  Similarly, [oi] does not take into account the finance charges and taxes; i.e. the items that managers have no control over.
