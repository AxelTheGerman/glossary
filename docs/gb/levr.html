<h1>Leverage Ratios - <span>gb</span></h1>
<p>LEVERAGE RATIOS incorporate any two of the following: [as], [eq], [lia]. 

Example: 
If you invest $60K of your money in a business, and borrow an additional $30K from the bank, you have assets of $90K.  You can express your leverage in several ways: 

Debt to Equity : 30/60 = .5 
Debt Ratio (i.e. Debt to Assets): 30/90 = .33

Both these numbers are expressing the same situation, and both can be called leverage. One person might say “We’re leveraged 50%”, while another could say “We’re leveraged 33%.”
