<h1>Acid-Test Ratio  - <span>gb</span></h1>
<p>Ratio: ([ca] less [inv]) divided by [cl]

This is a variant of the [cr]; it only includes items which are quickly converted into current assets. It is called ‘Acid-Test’ because it measures the ability to meet unexpected demands without depending on the sale of inventory.  

Also called Quick Ratio.
