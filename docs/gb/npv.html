<h1>Net Present Value (NPV) - <span>gb</span></h1>
<p>NPV is used to determine when, if ever, a capital investment will generate a profit, and how much that will be in today’s terms. The Net cash flows are considered in today’s terms (i.e. Present Value), because the money that comes in next year will be worth less than the money that goes out this year.  </p>
