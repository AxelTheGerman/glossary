<h1>Debt - <span>gb</span></h1>
<p>[wdym] This term can describe wildly different situations; here are some possibilities.

1) Total [as] less non interest-bearing liabilities (i.e. Net Assets).
2) Total [as] less [cl].
3) Total [as] less Total [lia] (i.e. [eq] or Net Worth).

And all of these terms are different from Net Asset Value. Make sure you agree on the meaning!</p>
