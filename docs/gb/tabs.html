<h1>Total Asset Balance Sheet - <span>gb</span></h1>
<p>A [bs] balancing the total [as] against the combined total of [lia] and [eq]. 

This is the simplest representation of Balance Sheet information, and is prevalent in North America. It shows the assets (what you have in the business) and balances that amount against the total of liabilities and equity (which is where the assets came from). In other words, everything you have in the business comes from investing (Capital Stock), making money (Retained Earnings ), or borrowing from sources such as banks (Loans) and suppliers (Accounts Payable (A/P) ).
