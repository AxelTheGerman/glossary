Operating Income is one of many possible finance terms for the same concept. It can also be known as:
  Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT), 
  Operating Profit,
  Measured Operating Income (MOI),
  Profit Before Interest and Tax (PBIT) in the United Kingdom, 
  Result No. 3 in Germany,
  The Primary Result in Denmark.

This is a real [wdym] with people sometimes using the two terms interchangeably.  We are using ‘margin’ is to denote a percentage (of Sales). 

Example:
- Sales of 200 less COS of 80 less Operating expense of 70 leaves Operating Profit of 50.
- Operating Profit of 50 divided by Sales of 200 equals Operating Margin of 25%.</p>
