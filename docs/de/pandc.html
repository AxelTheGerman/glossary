<h1>Profit & Cash  - <span>de</span></h1>
<p>Die deutsche Fassung wird zur Zeit noch uebersetzt...
Understanding the Cash Flow of a business is as essential as understanding Profit. 
  
[prof] is like food - you need it for the business to grow and to be healthy and strong; but you don’t have to eat all the time. But cash is like air – you need it constantly.  If you run out, and cannot immediately get more, you die.  

Profit happens on the [is]. Cash happens on the [bs]. The two have to be managed separately.</p>
