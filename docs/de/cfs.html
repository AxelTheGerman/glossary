<h1>Cash Flow Statement - <span>de</span></h1>
<p>Die deutsche Fassung wird zur Zeit noch uebersetzt...
Analysis of sources of cash that flowed into the business together with how the cash was allocated, for the accounting period. 

The information is grouped by functional department, because Cash can be freed up from anywhere (such as getting customers to pay faster, or paying suppliers more slowly), not just from Sales or the Finance Department.  

Note: Cash Flow does not consider non-cash items such as depreciation.
