<h1>Balance Sheet - <span>de</span></h1>
<p>Die deutsche Fassung wird zur Zeit noch uebersetzt...
A summary of the [as], [lia], and [eq] for the business at a certain point in time - it gives a financial snapshot for the given moment.  

The left side of the Company Board (and of the Income/Outcome business simulation game board) is a Balance Sheet.  See also [is].

The [tabs] used in North America shows the assets (what you have in the business) and balances that amount against the total of liabilities and equity (which is where the assets came from). In other words, everything you have in the business comes from investing ([cs]), making money ([re]), or borrowing from sources such as banks (Loans) and suppliers ([ap]). 

See also [nabs].
